I found all the errors before I n oticed the instruction to note them. Given that, here are the errors I noticed:
many omissions of "" sets
some omissions of <> or misuse of <></> pairs
Poor tabbing to distinguish objects. This is an issue in Python, I'm not sure if it is in HTML
The buttons for the colors were connected to the wrong colors and one was out of place so it didn't function at all
The syntax around the hyperlink was faulty
