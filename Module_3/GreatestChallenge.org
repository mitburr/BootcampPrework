I'm a chronic procrastinator. I have been since I was very young. When I was given a bedtime as a child I would often procrastinate sleep as a form of protest. This didn't turn out well for me: spoiler alert, kids need rest. As I transitioned into adulthood I found myself procrastinating to similar consequences in more important scenarios. I can work up anxiety about this, and often in these periods of procrastination I will do endless research. Learning is a solid way to assuage guilt about learning. Unfortunately, in most valuable pursuits, research is supplemental. The most important part of crafting a sword is hitting the iron. As such, I believe that I will need to focus closely on avoiding treating programming as a spectater sport.
